1. What do you use now for data storage and do you want to use cloud or local storage in the future?

The data storage that we use is the old traditional way where we store our files in boxes stored in a store room.
And since our faculty has been promising with constant growth since 2005, we have managed to accomodate at least 
6500 students every five years, therefore a cloud storage would be an option of choice

2. How long does the whole process take? What are the key time drainers in the systems? 

3. What is the budget? 

4. What is the estimated timeframe for the completion of the system?

5. How long must the student data remain in the system? 

How long the data remains in the database must be relative to the duration the student was in the colledge, meaning if
it was a degree student the data should remain for 4 years.
