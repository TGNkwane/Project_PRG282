Quetions:
1. What do you use now for data storage and do you want to use cloud or local storage in the future?

The data storage that we use is the old traditional way where we store our files in boxes stored in a store room.
And since our faculty has been promising with constant growth since 2005, we have managed to accomodate at least 
6500 students every five years, therefore a cloud storage would be an option of choice

2. How long does the whole process take? What are the key time drainers in the systems? 

The whole proceess at the end of every semester when students are given the evaluations and it takes
 approximately a week to two weeks as it has to be taken into consideration that the hard copy documents
 need to be courriered to the destination where they will be processed and sent back to the college so that they can
be available to students when they come back from recess which is three weeks.
Key Time Drainers:
-Taking the hard copy evaluation reports from the college to the IT service provider headquarters in order for them to be be digitised.
- Compressing the digital evaluation reports in order for them to be sent to the department head.


3. What is the estimated timeframe for the completion of the system?

One week, so that the students can get their evaluation reports during reccess.

4. How long must the student data remain in the system?

How long the data remains in the database must be relative to the duration the student was in the college, meaning if
it was a degree student the data should remain for 4 years.

5. Will the new system increase or decrease job loses (especially the admin assistants)

It will be dependent on whether the admin assistants can actually acquire the knowledge of operating the system in the allocated time for training completion.
In the case where the employee fails to be able to operate/use the system, they will be given a second attempt and if that does not go well too, then they might 
have to leave the organization. But regardless there will be few or close to no one being dismissed since our main objective is to invest in a system that will
be simple to use.

6. Where will the students access the evaulation form.

On the student portal.

7. What kind of Analysis will the data go through. (averages etc, 5 number summary)

- Students requests that wrere approved
- Total amount of students that managed to complete the evaluation 
- Evaluations that were disregarded 
- Average of students that completed the evaluation 
- The average time it takes a student to complete the evaluation 

8. Will evaulatons be complusory?

Yes, at the end of every sememster each student is supposed to fill in the evaluation form so that the department 
heads can gain insights of the institution from a students perspective.

9. Will the frequency of evalutons be more frequent should the time for feedback decrease?

Yes, the time for feedback should decrease as students are supposed to get back the report during recess but the
frequency of evaluations will remain constant, happening at the end of each semester which is twice a year.

10. Number of students currently enrolled and projected amount of students.

15 000 students are currently enrolled at our college and our projected amount in the next 10 years is at least 25 000 to 30 000 students

Test 1 SAD
Question 2 
A.) Business requirement are aligned with the companies best interests, so one could look at business requirement as the needs of a business, in instances where the system deployed is a software, we need to look at what the software needs to do for the user in order for the user’s needs to be fulfilled.
System requirements are quite similar to the business requirement as they also need to be fulfilled in order to have fully functional system but system requirements have to do with the integration of components to make a fully integrated system, e.g a dashboard (Portal) is designed to display the marks of students in a varsity but for the system to be fully operational we need to have a place a place where the data is centrally located, maybe on the cloud.
Before can call the system a portal, we need a cloud service to store the data so the cloud is a system requirement for a system which is the cloud.
