Quetions:
1. What do you use now for data storage and do you want to use cloud or local storage in the future?

The data storage that we use is the old traditional way where we store our files in boxes stored in a store room.
And since our faculty has been promising with constant growth since 2005, we have managed to accomodate at least 
6500 students every five years, therefore a cloud storage would be an option of choice

2. How long does the whole process take? What are the key time drainers in the systems? 

The whole proceess at the end of every semester when students are given the evaluations and it takes
 approximately a week to two weeks as it has to be taken into consideration that the hard copy documents
 need to be courriered to the destination where they will be processed and sent back to the college so that they can
be available to students when they come back from recess which is three weeks.
Key Time Drainers:
-Taking the hard copy evaluation reports from the college to the IT service provider headquarters in order for them to be be digitised.
- Compressing the digital evaluation reports in order for them to be sent to the department head.


3. What is the estimated timeframe for the completion of the system?

One week, so that the students can get their evaluation reports during reccess.

4. How long must the student data remain in the system? 

How long the data remains in the database must be relative to the duration the student was in the colledge, meaning if
it was a degree student the data should remain for 4 years.

5. Will the new system increase or decrease job loses (especially the admin assistants)

6. Where will the students access the evaulation form.

7. What kind of Analysis will the data go through. (averages etc, 5 number summary)

8. Will evaulatons be complusory?

9. Will the frequency of evalutons be more frequent should the time for feedback decrease?

10. Number of students currently enrolled and projected amount of students.
